## Environment variables
### Exercises 

1. On your student machine what is the value of the FLAG environment variable ?
> FLAG : 
```
BC{EXPORT_B4SH_FLAG}
```

1. Currently if you notice your machine, the variable you have created will be deleted. What should you do to make your variable persistent? (With a Bash shell).
> Commands :
```
EXPORT ENV=value
```

## Custom aliases 
Linux users often need to use one command over and over again. Typing or copying the same command again and again reduces your productivity and distracts you from what you are actually doing.

You can save yourself some time by creating aliases for your most used commands. Aliases are like custom shortcuts used to represent a command (or set of commands) executed with or without custom options. Chances are you are already using aliases on your Linux system.

You can see a list of defined aliases on your profile by simply executing alias command.

````sh
student@student:~$ alias
alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
alias grep='grep --color=auto'
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'

````

Here you can see the default aliases defined for your user in Ubuntu 16

Test it : 
````sh
student@student:~$ ll
total 148
drwxr-xr-x 5 student student  4096 May  3 23:36 ./
drwxr-xr-x 4 root    root     4096 May  1 17:39 ../
-rw------- 1 student student   863 May  2 08:30 .bash_history
-rw-r--r-- 1 student student   220 May  1 17:39 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 student student  4003 May  3 22:43 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 student student  4096 May  1 17:40 .cache/
-rw-r--r-- 1 root    root      209 May  1 23:12 employee.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 student student  4096 May  1 21:25 findme/
-rw-rw-r-- 1 student student  2330 May  3 23:40 .history
````

Is equivalent to running:

````sh
ls -alF
````

You can create an alias with a single character that will be equivalent to a command of your choice.

### How to Create Aliases in Linux

Creating aliases is relatively easy and quick process. You can create two types of aliases â€“ temporary ones and permanent. We will review both types.

* **Creating Temporary Aliases** : What you need to do is type the word alias then use the name you wish to use to execute a command followed by "=" sign and quote the command you wish to alias.

    ````
    $ alias shortName="your custom command here"
    ````
* **To keep aliases between sessions**, you can save them in your user's shell configuration profile file. This can be:
    - Bash : ~/.bashrc
    - ZSH : ~/.zshrc
    - Fish : ~/.config/fish/config.fish

The syntax you should use is practically the same as creating a temporary alias. The only difference comes from the fact that you will be saving it in a file this time. So for example, in bash, you can open .bashrc file with your favorite editor like this:

````
nano ~/.bashrc
````

Find a place in the file, where you want to keep the aliases. For example, you can add them in the end of the file. For organizations purposes you can leave a comment before your aliases something like this:

````
#My custom aliases
alias home="ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykep.pem tecmint@192.168.0.100"
alias ll="ls -alF"
````

Save the file. The file will be automatically loaded in your next session. If you want to use the newly defined alias in the current session, issue the following command:

````
source ~/.bashrc
````

Well! Now it's time to optimize your workspace and create your own aliases!
